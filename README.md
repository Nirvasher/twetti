# Twetti
Very, very, very simple "tweeter"-app, which uses Laravel and Vue.js. The user can register, log in and post something. The vue fetches a json-file which displays posts from the database. Note that the json-file is not paginated and will continue for ever, so this is mostly an example and should NOT be used in production.
